  <h2>Core Strengths</h2>

  <div class="experience-item">
    <strong>Clinical Expertise – Critical Care Nurse Practitioner</strong><br>
    I practice as a Critical Care Nurse Practitioner in Mayo Clinic’s ICU environments and also provide coverage in Hospital Internal Medicine within the Mayo Clinic Health System. Having served as both a bedside nurse and APRN across MCHS and Rochester, I bring a deep understanding of clinical workflows, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the realities of patient care across the continuum.
  </div>

  <div class="experience-item">
    <strong>Epic Provider Builder & Data-Driven Innovator</strong><br>
    I collaborate with Mayo Clinic’s analytics and informatics teams to design user-centered dashboards and build tools that enhance clinical decision-making, workflow efficiency, and data transparency at scale.
  </div>

  <div class="experience-item">
    <strong>Innovation Leadership – RAPID Framework</strong><br>
    I founded the RAPID (Rapidly Accelerating Problems and Ideas) framework to empower frontline teams to identify system-level gaps and accelerate innovation. This model has expanded hospital-wide, creating a faster, more transparent pathway for problem-solving and improvement.
  </div>

  <div class="experience-item">
    <strong>A Multi-Dimensional Perspective</strong><br>
    My background across information technology, nursing, advanced practice, business, and leadership shapes how I approach challenges—holistically, strategically, and with empathy. I understand both the human side of care and the technical infrastructure that supports it.
  </div>

  <div class="experience-item">
    <strong>Systems Thinker</strong><br>
    From deploying communication networks in the Air Force to integrating enterprise technology in healthcare, I’ve learned that lasting success depends on more than infrastructure—it requires alignment of people, processes, and purpose. I connect clinical insight, operational strategy, and digital innovation to drive sustainable transformation.
  </div>

  <div class="experience-item">
    <strong>Cross-Disciplinary Translation & Collaboration</strong><br>
    I’ve spent my career working across clinical, technical, and operational domains — aligning teams around shared goals and designing solutions that balance innovation with practical execution.
