          <h2>PIM3 Score Automation in Epic</h2>
          <p>
            Automated the Pediatric Index of Mortality 3 (PIM3) score within Epic, converting non-discrete clinical input into a fully integrated, automatable workflow. This replaced manual abstraction for 1–2 full-time equivalents (FTEs) and improved the timeliness and reliability of pediatric risk stratification.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project advanced clinical decision support by embedding a validated severity-of-illness model directly into the EMR, enhancing safety, operational efficiency, and cross-team engagement.

        <div class="project-item" id="rounding">
          <h2>ICU Daily Rounding Tool Automation</h2>
          <p>
            Designed and integrated an automated Daily Rounding Tool directly into Epic to ensure consistent adherence to ICU best practices across patient care teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            This build streamlined multidisciplinary rounds by embedding structured prompts and checklists into the existing Epic workflow, reducing missed interventions and supporting real-time documentation. The tool reinforces evidence-based practices such as sedation vacations, mobility assessments, and device necessity reviews — all without adding documentation burden.

        <div class="project-item" id="rapid">
          <h2>RAPID: Frontline Innovation Framework</h2>
          <p>
            Founded RAPID (Rapidly Accelerating Problems and Ideas) framework to elevate frontline innovation and accelerate system-level improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            What began as a single-unit initiative evolved into a hospital-wide model for engagement and transparency. RAPID empowers staff to identify challenges, propose solutions, and track outcomes—creating a culture of ownership, agility, and collaborative problem-solving.

        <div class="project-item" id="cedar">
          <h2>CEDAR: Clinical Event Detection and Response</h2>
          <p>
            Contributed to the development and early implementation of CEDAR, a clinical event detection system designed to identify and escalate deteriorating patients across the hospital.
          </p>
          <p>
            Helped shape early logic, alert thresholds, and clinician-facing workflows, integrating real-time monitoring and Epic-based alert delivery. The project aimed to support earlier recognition of clinical decline and improve team communication through actionable insights. Though I later transitioned away from the project, my contributions informed its foundational structure and clinical integration approach.

        <div class="project-item" id="stayconf">
          <h2>Critical Care Stay Conference</h2>
          <p>
            Launched and organized the Critical Care Stay Conference — a multidisciplinary, hospital-based conference designed to support critical care staff who were unable to attend national events due to financial or scheduling constraints.
          </p>
          <p>
            This free, on-site conference brought together nurses, physicians, APPs, pharmacists, therapists, and other critical care professionals for a shared learning experience. By leveraging internal speakers, case-based panels, and practical sessions, we created a high-quality educational offering that strengthened the local critical care community, fostered collaboration, and ensured equitable access to professional development.

        <div class="project-item" id="ccm-dashboards">
          <h2>Critical Care Dashboards</h2>
          <p>
            Partnered with Critical Care Medicine and hospital analytics teams to design, prioritize, and deploy dashboards for operational, quality, and research metrics.

          <h2>Deployable Military Communications</h2>
          <p>
            Led the setup of fully deployable IT and communication networks during my service in the U.S. Air Force—from generator-based power to satellite connectivity and end-user systems.
