          <h2>PIM3 Score Automation in Epic</h2>
          <p>
            Transforms unstructured clinical input into actionable, automatable workflows within Epic — improving safety, operational efficiency, and cross-team engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            I led the automation of the Pediatric Index of Mortality 3 (PIM3) score — a severity-of-illness model used in pediatric critical care — which traditionally requires manual abstraction of non-discrete data elements. By integrating this into Epic, we replaced the need for 1–2 full-time abstractors (FTEs), depending on patient volume, and improved timeliness and reliability of risk stratification.

          <h2>ICU Daily Rounding Tool Automation</h2>
          <p>
            Integrated an automated Daily Rounding Tool directly into Epic to ensure consistent adherence to ICU best practices across patient care teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            This build streamlined multidisciplinary rounds by embedding structured prompts and checklists into the existing Epic workflow, reducing missed interventions and supporting real-time documentation. The tool reinforces evidence-based practices such as sedation vacations, mobility assessments, and device necessity reviews — all without adding documentation burden.

        <div class="project-item" id="rapid">
          <h2>RAPID: Frontline Innovation Framework</h2>
          <p>
            Created RAPID (Rapidly Accelerating Problems and Ideas), a framework designed to elevate frontline insights and connect them directly to leadership decision-making.
          </p>
          <p>
            What began as a grassroots initiative in a single ICU unit grew into a hospital-wide innovation model. RAPID empowers staff to identify problems, propose solutions, and track outcomes — fostering a culture of ownership, engagement, and continuous improvement. The framework has helped reduce communication gaps, surface high-impact ideas, and align frontline innovation with system-level goals.

        <div class="project-item" id="cedar">
          <h2>CEDAR: Clinical Event Detection and Response</h2>
          <p>
            Contributed to the development and early implementation of CEDAR, a clinical event detection system designed to identify and escalate deteriorating patients across the hospital.
          </p>
          <p>
            Helped shape early logic, alert thresholds, and clinician-facing workflows, integrating real-time monitoring and Epic-based alert delivery. The project aimed to support earlier recognition of clinical decline and improve team communication through actionable insights. Though I later transitioned away from the project, my contributions informed its foundational structure and clinical integration approach.

        <div class="project-item" id="stayconf">
          <h2>Critical Care Stay Conference</h2>
          <p>
            Launched and organized the Critical Care Stay Conference — a multidisciplinary, hospital-based conference designed to support critical care staff who were unable to attend national events due to financial or scheduling constraints.
          </p>
          <p>
            This free, on-site conference brought together nurses, physicians, APPs, pharmacists, therapists, and other critical care professionals for a shared learning experience. By leveraging internal speakers, case-based panels, and practical sessions, we created a high-quality educational offering that strengthened the local critical care community, fostered collaboration, and ensured equitable access to professional development.

        <div class="project-item" id="ccm-dashboards">
          <h2>Critical Care Dashboards</h2>
          <p>
            I collaborate with the Critical Care Medicine and hospital analytics teams to define, build, and prioritize dashboards for operational, quality, and research metrics. These dashboards support clinical leadership and frontline teams with actionable insights, including performance tracking, patient outcomes, and workflow efficiency.

        <div class="project-item" id="military-it">
          <h2>Deployable Military Communications</h2>
          <p>
            During my time in the U.S. Air Force, I led the setup of fully deployable communication networks — from generator-based power to satellite connectivity and end-user systems. These field-ready systems ensured secure, mission-critical access to technology in austere and unpredictable environments.
