      <p>
        Below are some of the projects I'm most proud of — efforts that reflect my passion for combining clinical insight, technology, and team-based innovation to improve care.

        <h2>PIM3 Score Automation in Epic</h2>
        <p>
          Transforms unstructured clinical input into actionable, automatable workflows within Epic — improving safety, operational efficiency, and cross-team engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I led the automation of the Pediatric Index of Mortality 3 (PIM3) score — a severity-of-illness model used in pediatric critical care — which traditionally requires manual abstraction of non-discrete data elements. By integrating this into Epic, we replaced the need for 1–2 full-time abstractors (FTEs), depending on patient volume, and improved timeliness and reliability of risk stratification.

      <div class="project-item" id="rounding">
        <h2>ICU Daily Rounding Tool Automation</h2>
        <p>
          Integrated an automated Daily Rounding Tool directly into Epic to ensure consistent adherence to ICU best practices across patient care teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          This build streamlined multidisciplinary rounds by embedding structured prompts and checklists into the existing Epic workflow, reducing missed interventions and supporting real-time documentation. The tool reinforces evidence-based practices such as sedation vacations, mobility assessments, and device necessity reviews — all without adding documentation burden.

      <div class="project-item" id="rapid">
        <h2>RAPID: Frontline Innovation Framework</h2>
        <p>
          Created RAPID (Rapidly Accelerating Problems and Ideas), a framework designed to elevate frontline insights and connect them directly to leadership decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          What began as a grassroots initiative in a single ICU unit grew into a hospital-wide innovation model. RAPID empowers staff to identify problems, propose solutions, and track outcomes — fostering a culture of ownership, engagement, and continuous improvement. The framework has helped reduce communication gaps, surface high-impact ideas, and align frontline innovation with system-level goals.
        </p>

      <div class="project-item" id="cedar">
        <h2>CEDAR: Clinical Event Detection and Response</h2>
        <p>
          Contributed to the development and early implementation of CEDAR, a clinical event detection system designed to identify and escalate deteriorating patients across the hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
          Helped shape early logic, alert thresholds, and clinician-facing workflows, integrating real-time monitoring and Epic-based alert delivery. The project aimed to support earlier recognition of clinical decline and improve team communication through actionable insights. Though I later transitioned away from the project, my contributions informed its foundational structure and clinical integration approach.

      <div class="project-item" id="stayconf">
        <h2>Critical Care Stay Conference</h2>
        <p>
          Launched and organized the Critical Care Stay Conference — a multidisciplinary, hospital-based conference designed to support critical care staff who were unable to attend national events due to financial or scheduling constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          This free, on-site conference brought together nurses, physicians, APPs, pharmacists, therapists, and other critical care professionals for a shared learning experience. By leveraging internal speakers, case-based panels, and practical sessions, we created a high-quality educational offering that strengthened the local critical care community, fostered collaboration, and ensured equitable access to professional development.
