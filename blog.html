          <h2>Adaptive Early Warning at the Mayo Clinic AI Summit</h2>
          <p><em>July 2025</em></p>
          <img src="assets/summit.png" alt="Mayo Clinic AI Summit Poster Presentation" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />
          <p>
            Today I had the opportunity to present my poster at the Mayo Clinic AI Summit on a project close to my heart: using adaptive time frames and volatility metrics to improve early warning systems for patient deterioration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of static thresholds or fixed time windows, I developed a model that adapts based on how often vitals and labs are checked. The goal is to improve real-time alerting and reduce noise while still catching critical changes early.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is part of my ongoing work to build smarter, context-aware clinical tools that actually work for frontline teams — because in healthcare, timing isn't everything… but it's close.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was inspiring to see the energy around healthcare AI today — from predictive models to workflow optimization — and to share space with others passionate about using data responsibly and effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m especially proud that this project brings together my background in nursing, as a nurse practitioner, operations, and analytics.
          </p>
          <p>
            More to come soon. I’m always up for collaborating on meaningful projects at the intersection of care and computation.

          <h2>Making ICU Best Practices Automatic</h2>
          <p><em>July 2025</em></p>
          <p>
            Our medical ICU had a rounding tool — but it was paper-based, hard to track, and easy to skip. We built a fully electronic version directly in Epic that made it easier for teams to follow best practices like sedation vacations and mobility checks without adding clicks or extra documentation.
            Now it's being scaled across the hospital to improve rounding consistency and reduce variation — one checklist item at a time.

          <h2>Why We Built a Conference That Doesn’t Require a Plane Ticket</h2>
          <p><em>December 2024</em></p>
          <p>
            The Critical Care Stay Conference started with a simple idea: what if meaningful professional development didn’t require leaving the hospital, using PTO, or paying hundreds in registration fees?
            We brought that idea to life — and in doing so, created a new kind of learning space grounded in accessibility, relevance, and community.

          <h2>What Makes RAPID Work: Innovation from the Bedside Up</h2>
          <p><em>May 2024</em></p>
          <p>
            When we created RAPID, we weren’t just solving problems — we were building a new way to surface them. Frontline staff are often closest to the issues, yet furthest from the decision-making process.
            RAPID gave them a structured, visible, and fast way to elevate insights to leadership — and that changed everything.
