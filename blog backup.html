  <h2>From Paper to Platform: How We Modernized the ICU Rounding Tool</h2>
  <p><em>July 2025</em></p>
  <p>
    Daily ICU rounding is one of the most important touchpoints for patient care, but for years, many teams relied on informal checklists, printed handouts, or hallway conversations to make sure best practices were covered. In our Medical ICU, we saw an opportunity to streamline and standardize the process — and we built it directly into Epic.
  </p>
  <p>
    We worked closely with clinicians to understand what mattered most during rounds: key interventions like sedation vacations, mobility assessments, device necessity, and nutrition planning. Then we embedded those checks into a digital ICU rounding tool that fits naturally into the existing workflow — no extra logins, no duplicate documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The result? A cleaner, more efficient, and more reliable rounding process that ensures nothing important is missed. It also supports multidisciplinary collaboration by making expectations and responsibilities clear to all team members.
  </p>
  <p>
    After piloting in the Medical ICU, the tool has been adopted by other ICUs across the hospital — tailored slightly for their needs, but grounded in the same principles of visibility, consistency, and ease of use. It’s a great example of how thoughtful automation can actually make care better without adding more work.

      <h2>Why We Built a Conference That Doesn’t Require a Plane Ticket</h2>
      <p><em>December 2024</em></p>
      <p>
        The Critical Care Stay Conference started with a simple idea: what if meaningful professional development didn’t require leaving the hospital, using PTO, or paying hundreds in registration fees?
        We brought that idea to life — and in doing so, created a new kind of learning space grounded in accessibility, relevance, and community.

  <h2>What Makes RAPID Work: Innovation from the Bedside Up</h2>
  <p><em>May 2024</em></p>
  <p>
    When we created RAPID (Rapidly Accelerating Problems and Ideas), we weren’t just solving problems — we were building a new way to surface them. Frontline staff are often closest to the issues, yet furthest from the decision-making process. RAPID was our response to that disconnect.
  </p>
  <p>
    It started small — a grassroots effort in one ICU unit. We created a simple, structured way for staff to submit concerns, ideas, and pain points that were getting missed in the noise of day-to-day operations. No big committees, no complicated forms — just honest, focused input from the people doing the work.
  </p>
  <p>
    The response was immediate. Nurses, techs, APPs, therapists, physicians all appreciated having a forum where their voices were not just heard — but acted on. Each RAPID submission was reviewed by a cross-functional team, with outcomes tracked, solutions shared, and barriers addressed openly.
  </p>
  <p>
    As momentum grew, so did RAPID. What started as a unit-level experiment became a hospital-wide initiative, used across departments to elevate issues, track resolutions, and close the loop on communication. The process built trust. It created visibility. And most importantly, it made improvement feel like something <em>we</em> do together — not something done to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    RAPID isn’t flashy. It’s not software or a dashboard. But it works because it taps into what healthcare teams have always needed: a reliable, respectful channel to make things better — one problem, one idea at a time.
